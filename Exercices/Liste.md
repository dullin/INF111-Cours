* Hello world!
* Hello with horaire
* Hello with input of first and last name
* Hello with input of two values and multiply
* Input value, square it
* Input two values, show smallest
* Input two valeus, show largest
* Input value, show positive, negative or nul
* Input x,y, show quadrant
* IMC
* Min between 3 values
* Formated time from seconds
* Show factors of n
* Star square
* Star triangle
* Star X
* Count number of digits. No strings
* isprime
* show n prime
* sum of odd digits

* Input initial investment, interest. Show number of years before investment reaches 1 millions
* Input n. Input n times, shows largest and lowest of inputs.
* Until input 0, input numbers. Show cumulative value
* Write a program that reads a number and prints all of its binary digits: Print the remainder number % 2, then replace the number with number / 2. Keep going until the number is 0. For example, if the user provides the input 13, the output should be
1 0 1 1

* Write a program that prints a multiplication table, like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
.. .
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

* check that the credit card number is valid. A valid credit card number will yield a result divisible by 10 when you:
Form the sum of all digits. Add to that sum every second digit, starting with the second digit from the right. Then add the number of digits in the second step that are greater than four. The result should be divisible by 10.
For example, consider the number 4012 8888 8888 1881. The sum of all digits is 89. The sum of the colored digits is 46. There are five colored digits larger than four, so the result is 140. 140 is divisible by 10 so the card number is valid.
